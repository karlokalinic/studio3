# Nexus Chronicles Game Design Document

## 1. Core Concept

**Nexus Chronicles** is a single-player, narrative-driven RPG set in a post-cataclysmic universe where technology and magic have merged. Players take on the role of a "Nexus Walker," an individual with the rare ability to travel between different dimensions.

The core gameplay loop revolves around exploration, complex narrative choices, and deep character customization.

## 2. Character Progression

The progression system is built on two interconnected trees: "The Self" and "Nexus Attunement."

### The Self (Top-Down Tree)

This tree represents the character's innate physical and mental capabilities.

- **Strength:** Governs physical power, melee damage, and carry capacity.
- **Intelligence:** Affects hacking, problem-solving, and critical hit chance.
- **Spirit:** Controls willpower, psionic abilities, and social interactions.

Each core attribute has a corresponding **"Curse"** that activates at higher levels, representing the trade-off for pushing human limits (e.g., Strength's "Adrenal Burnout").

### Nexus Attunement (Bottom-Up Tree)

This tree represents the character's alignment with the universe's fundamental forces.

- **Path of Order:** Focuses on technology, logic, and defensive abilities.
- **Path of Chaos:** Unlocks reality-warping powers and unpredictable outcomes.
- **Path of Balance:** Grants abilities related to healing, symbiosis, and environmental control.

### The Convergence Zone

The most powerful abilities are found where the two trees meet, requiring high investment in both a core attribute and a specific Nexus path to unlock synergistic skills (e.g., high Intelligence + Path of Order = "Techno-Golem Summon").

## 3. Gameplay Mechanics

- **Attribute Checks:** Actions are resolved by comparing an "Effective" stat against a target number. The effective stat is calculated from the base attribute, modified by dynamic states (fatigue, focus), active curses, and game difficulty.
- **State Management:** Players must manage Health, Energy, Hunger, Fatigue, and Focus.
- **Narrative Choices:** The story unfolds through the Mission Control panel, where choices have significant and lasting consequences on quests and faction reputation.

## 4. World & Factions

- **The Setting:** The game takes place in the year 2387, two centuries after the "Great Disconnection."
- **Factions:**
    - **Solaris Coalition:** Technocratic and orderly.
    - **Abyssal Depths:** Mystical and isolationist.
    - **Sky Citadels:** Individualistic and trade-focused.
    - **Void Walkers:** Nomadic knowledge-seekers.
    - **Neural Collective:** A hive-mind society.
